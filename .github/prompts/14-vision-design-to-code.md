# Vision - Login Page Example

# New Chat: GPT-4.1

Drag the image under /frontend/public/login-mockup.png to the chat

```
Based on this mockup image, add a login screen, keeping to the style of the attached mockup to the extent possible, making it the first screen the user sees.

For the red superman-like LOGO image on the top of the login screen, use this img <img src="/login-log.png" alt="Login Logo"/>

Make it mobile compatible and responsive, follow frontend guidelines and frameworks of this project.

Place the login code under /frontend/src/Login.js and /frontend/src/Login.css, and make needed changes to other files like App.js

For the sake of keeping things simple as this is a demo app - don't actually perform any authentication and allow the user to continue without typing any provided username/password entered or even leave blank. Don't do any state management (as-in logged in etc.) or make changes to other screens other than the new login screens

No need to add tests for this screen.

Let's run a quick check ourselves in our Simple Browser:
Cmd + Shift + P: Simple Browser
```
http://localhost:3001
```

NOTE: In Simple Browser you can select DOM elements and add them to chat as context, to work on them with Copilot.

NOTE: User Copilot with vision for use cases like architecture analysis and review, task planning from product flows, paste web console errors, UI bug screenshots, diagrams from your office whiteboard discussions, etc.
